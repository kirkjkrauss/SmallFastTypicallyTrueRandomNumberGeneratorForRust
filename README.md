# SmallFastTypicallyTrueRandomNumberGeneratorForRust
Small, fast, typically true random number generator

This native code random number generator provides Rust's cross-platform interoperability to an existing high-performance method for deriving typically true random numbers based on the system clock.  It's a short drop-in function whose design, plus common use cases, are described at https://developforperformance.com/RandomTreatmentForRandomData.html.
